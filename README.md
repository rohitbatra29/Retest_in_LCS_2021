Code for statistical models used in the manuscript.

The code is organised into three different sections based on the three different specifications proposed in the paper:

1. Lavaan code for retest as an observed covariate at the structural level
2. Dynr code for retest as a latent covariate at the structural level
3. Mplus code for retest as an observed covariate at the measurement level
