This page is dedicated to the code used for the statistical analysis in the paper. Following are the names of the files for the three different specifications proposed in the paper:

1. Lavaan code for retest as an observed covariate at the structural level

    File: 1_Retest_as_observed_Structural.R

2. Dynr code for retest as a latent covariate at the structural level

    File: 2_Retest_as_latent_Structural.R

3. Mplus code for retest as an observed covariate at the measurement level

    Files: 
     
     3.1_2LCS_no_retest.inp
    
     3.2_2CS_1gamma.inp
