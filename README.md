# Modeling Retest Effects in Developmental Processes Using Latent Change Score Models
(this page is a work in progress)

Preprint link: https://psyarxiv.com/gu78q

This page is dedicated to the code used in the statistical analysis in the paper. The code is organised into three different sections based on the three different specifications proposed in the paper:

1. Lavaan code for retest as an observed covariate at the structural level

    File: 1_Retest_as_observed_Structural.R

2. Dynr code for retest as a latent covariate at the structural level

    File: 2_Retest_as_latent_Structural.R

3. Mplus code for retest as an observed covariate at the measurement level

    Files: 
     
     3.1_2LCS_no_retest.inp
    
     3.2_2CS_1gamma.inp
     
     3.3_2LCS_multi_gamma.inp
